#+TITLE: Put X windows in the background

* Introduction

This package allows you to put X windows, or other EXWM workspaces, behind a transparent EXWM workspace, a nice alternative to alt-tabbing between two windows, or splitting valuable screen space between two windows.

* Setup 

The easiest way to install this package is through MELPA. Jokes on you though, this package isn't in MELPA yet, so here's how you do it. 

1. Make sure you install exwm through other means. 
2. Clone this repository to /whatever/path/you/want
3. ~(add-to-list 'load-path "/whatever/path/you/want")~
4. ~(require 'exwm-background)~
